const twoSum = function(nums, target) {

};


Detailed Breakdown
1. let map = new Map();
This creates a new Map object called map which will be used to store numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array.
2. for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
This starts a for loop that will iterate over each element in the nums array. The loop variable i represents the current index.
3. let complement = target - nums[i];
This line calculates the value needed to add to nums[i] to reach the target. This value is called the complement.
4. if (map.has(complement)) 
map.has(complement): This checks if the complement value is already in the map. The Map object provides a has method that returns true if the map contains a specific key, and false otherwise.
The purpose of this check is to see if we have previously encountered a number in the array that can be added to the current number nums[i] to get the target.
3. return [map.get(complement), i];
map.get(complement): If the map contains the complement, we retrieve the index of the complement using the get method. This method returns the value associated with the specified key in the map.
return [map.get(complement), i];: We return an array containing two indices:
    -numMap.get(complement): The index of the complement.
    -i: The current index.
This return statement effectively stops the execution of the function and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
4. numMap.set(nums[i], i);
If the complement does not exist in the map, we add the current number nums[i] to the map with its index i as the value. This allows us to check for this number as a complement in future iterations.

Detailed Explanation of complement
1. Understanding the Objective
You want to find two numbers, say x and y, such that x + y = target.
For each number x in the array, you can express the problem as finding another number y such that y = target - x.
2. Iterating Over the Array
As you iterate through each element in the array (nums[i]):

    -nums[i] is the current number x you're looking at.
    -To find the number y that, when added to x, equals target, you compute y as target - x.
3. Calculating the Complement
Let's break down let complement = target - nums[i];:

    -nums[i]: This is the current element in the array you're considering.
    -target: This is the target sum you're trying to achieve with two numbers from the array.
    -target - nums[i]: This calculation gives you the value that, when added to nums[i], equals the target. This value is what you're looking for in the rest of the array.

Example & Explanation
Suppose nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9.

On the first iteration (i = 0):
nums[i] is 2.
target - nums[i] is 9 - 2 which equals 7.
So, complement is 7.
This means you are looking for the number 7 in the rest of the array to pair with 2 to sum up to 9.

Using the Complement
You then check if this complement (in this case, 7) has already been seen and stored in the map (map).
If it has, it means you have found the two numbers (2 and 7) that add up to the target (9).
If it hasn't, you store the current number (2) and its index in the map and continue with the next iteration.
Conclusion
The line let complement = target - nums[i]; is central to the logic of finding the two numbers that add up to the target. It calculates the required value (complement) that, when added to the current number (nums[i]), equals the target. This value is then checked against previously seen numbers to see if it has already been encountered in the array.
