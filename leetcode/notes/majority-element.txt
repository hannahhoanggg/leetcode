Detailed Breakdown

1. const majorityElement = function(nums)
This line defines a constant variable majorityElement and assigns it an anonymous function that takes nums as its parameter. nums is expected to be an array of numbers.
2. let count = {};
This line initializes an empty object count. This object will be used to store the frequency of each number in the nums array.
3. for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
This starts a for loop that iterates over each element in the nums array. The loop variable i will go from 0 to nums.length - 1.
4. const num = nums[i];
 Inside the loop, num is assigned the value of the current element in the nums array (nums[i]).
 This line extracts the current number being processed in the loop and stores it in num.
5.  if (!count[num]) {
            count[num] = 1;
        } else {
            count[num]++;
        }
This if-else block checks if the current number num is already a key in the count object:
    -If count[num] does not exist (i.e., num has not been encountered before), it initializes count[num] to 1.
    -If count[num] already exists, it increments the value associated with num by 1.

if (!count[num]) 
 checks if the current number num is not already a key in the count object.
The ! operator negates the condition, so !count[num] evaluates to true if count[num] is undefined or false.

count[num] = 1;
This initializes the count for the current number num to 1, indicating that this is the first time num has been encountered.

count[num]++;
This increases the count for the current number num by 1, reflecting that num has been encountered again.
6.  if (count[num] > nums.length / 2) {
        return num;
    }
This checks if the count of the current number num exceeds half the length of the nums array:
    -If count[num] is greater than nums.length / 2, it means num is the majority element.
    -The function returns num as the majority element.

Summary
The function majorityElement finds the majority element in an array (an element that appears more than half the time). It does this by:

    -Initializing an empty object to keep track of the counts of each element.
    -Iterating through the array and updating the counts.
    -Checking if any count exceeds half the length of the array, and if so, returning that element immediately.
